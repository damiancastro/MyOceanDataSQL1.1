These files include the OUA application (OceanData+.exe) and its dependencies (mysql-connector-odbc-5.3.8-win32.msi and vcredist_2015_x86.exe).

First install the dependencies and then copy and paste OceanData+.exe with its configuration file config.xml in a folder of your choice (where you have read, write and execute access).

Then you may run OUA by launching the OceanData+ executable.
